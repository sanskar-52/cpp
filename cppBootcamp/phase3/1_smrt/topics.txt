smart pointers
there are many types of smart pointer and the first one is being-
1.unique pointer frees up the memory as soon as the scope ends.
scope is usually deifned by {}
you can not copy unique pointer. matlab sirf ek unique pointer hi point kar sakta hai memory ke taraf
we have a seperate pointer which is allowed to be copyed

unique pointer kya fix karta hai?
new ke baad delete karne ki jarurat nahi hai apne aap delete ho jayega scope khtm hone par
uniqe pointer ko delete karne ke baad usko access nahi kar sakte //it becomes null pointer, preventing accidental access.
ek location ko ek hi unique pointer point karega

int* ptr = new int(5);
int* another_ptr = ptr;
delete another_ptr; 
// Now ptr points to invalid memory!   unique pointer moves the ownership cannot copy.

shared pointer 
//when all the shared pointer done with their job then memory will be freed up.

weak pointer
weak pointer ko koi nahi puchta
ie nobody is keeping track of weak pointer
only allowed to keep refernce // weak_pointer<user> = ptr1;      ptr1 is another shared pointer.
