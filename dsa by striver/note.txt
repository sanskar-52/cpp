There is no issue , do it in any language. They are just data structures.

Only difference is the syntax and some methods which each languages have.

No it won't be enough and my advice is not to go for hundreds for videos. You won't be able to finish it like that.

Refere to a sheet, learn topicwise, search, solve, and if solving on leetcode the various solutions and explanation from the solutions tab will help you a lot more than watching hubdreds of videos.

You will get to see many approaches there and my recommendation is to start giving contests on codechef and then shift to codeforces once you have a grip and done with advanced topics.

Till then learn and grind on Leetcode, Geeksforgeeks.

Don't wait like first I will finish whole dsa and then start solving, learn solve, explore, find, solve doubts, search, refer, repeat
