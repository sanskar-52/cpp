// For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign represents its direction(positive meaning right, negative meaning left).Each asteroid moves at the same speed.

// Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions.If two asteroids meet,
// the smaller one will explode.If both are the same size, both will explode.Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet.

// Input : asteroids = [ 3, 5, -6, 2, -1, 4 ]​​​​​​​ Output : [ -6, 2, 4 ]
