// Problem Statement: Given an array ‘arr’ of integer numbers, ‘arr[i]’ represents
// the number of pages in the ‘i-th’ book. There are ‘m’ number of students,
// and the task is to allocate all the books to the students.
// Allocate books in such a way that:
// Each student gets at least one book.
// Each book should be allocated to only one student.
// Book allocation should be in a contiguous manner.
// You have to allocate the books to ‘m’ students such that
// the maximum number of pages assigned to a student is minimum.
// If the allocation of books is not possible, return -1.
