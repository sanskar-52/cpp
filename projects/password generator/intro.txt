Password generator - Flow
Let us think about how would we build this project.

We know the following rules - the password generator should take the following as user inputs

Length of the password.
The 1st character should necessarily be an alphabet
Are numeric characters / numbers required in the password?
Are special characters required in the password?
Let us use the following flow

User input
Accept user input for Length of the password as an integer (length N)
Accept user input for 'use_special_chars' as 'Yes / No'
Accept user input for 'use_numbers' as 'Yes / No'

Password construction
Create a random password of length (N−2)
consisting only alphabets. Remember that the 1st character of the password should necessarily be an alphabet

If 'use_numbers' is 'Yes', then concatenate any random number at the end. 
If it is 'No', then concatenate any random alphabet at the end. Now the password string has length (N−1).

If 'use_special_chars' is 'Yes', then concatenate any random special character at the end.
If it is 'No', then concatenate any random alphabet at the end. Now the password string has length N.

Once the password has been constructed - output the same for the user
Note that the above is just one of the options.
You can also choose alternate methods to ensure that the password meets the 3 conditions given above - for e.g. - the 2nd character of the password can be a number. Similarly - the number can have more than 1 number or special character.
